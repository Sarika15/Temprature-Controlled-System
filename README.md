# Temprature-Controlled-System
Generally in different climatic conditions people will trying to turn ON or OFF cooler or heater in their room by manually. But, by doing this manually is a little bit tedious task and not accurate. Switching regulator on heater or cooler mode more often through manual control may damage the regulator and sometimes leads to current shock. The above discussed problems can be avoided by implementing the automatic temperature control system. A sensor is placed in the room to sense the room temperature in degree centigrade. According to detected temperature a control circuit will turn on cooler or heater. If the room temperature is more than set point, then cooler will turn ON. If the room temperature is less than set point, then the heater will turn ON automatically by the control circuit. The components used to implement this project are temperature sensor LM35, an ARM controller TM4C123G, 16*2 LCD, ADC, LED, UART.
